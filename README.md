Flutter Fast Forms is a library for building Flutter forms fast and the only package you'll ever need again to do so.
It adds major enhancements to the Flutter core framework while being fully in line with it:

* `FormField<T>` extensions for all Material input widgets
* `InputDecoration` for all Material form fields
* Adaptable / Platform-aware form field widgets
* Validation states beyond `AutovalidateMode`
