Flutter Fast Forms is a package for building Flutter forms fast.

It enhances the Flutter SDK with 

* a set of framework-compliant `FormField<T>` wrappers for all [Material input / selection components](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material#Input%20and%20selections) 
that provide platform-specific `FormFieldBuilder<T>`
* a lightweight meta layer of adaptive form widgets that allows for custom validation states beyond `AutovalidateMode` 
and populating field values on `Form` changes
