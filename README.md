Flutter Fast Forms is a package for building Flutter forms fast - and probably the only dependency 
you'll ever need again to do so. 

The library is fully in line with the Flutter core framework and adds major enhancements to it:

* `FormField<T>` extensions for all Material input & selection components
* Platform-specific `FormFieldBuilder<T>` and adaptive form field widgets
* Validation states for displaying error texts beyond `AutovalidateMode`
