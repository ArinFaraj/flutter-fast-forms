Flutter Fast Forms is a package for building Flutter forms fast.

It enhances the Flutter SDK with framework-compliant `FormField<T>` wrappers for all [Material input / selection components](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material#Input%20and%20selections) 
and adds a lightweight layer of adaptive meta widgets that provide platform-specific `FormFieldBuilder<T>`. 
That allows for custom validation states beyond `AutovalidateMode` and populating field values on `Form` changes.
